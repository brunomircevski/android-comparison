\section{Introduction}
Android is the dominant mobile operating system and acts as a primary gateway to digital world for billions of users. It's crucial for core OS to be a reliable, stable and trustworthy platform, that allows users to run apps and services of their choice. While mobile app privacy has been widely studied \cite{appDataCollection1,appDataCollection2,appDataCollection3,appDataCollection4}, less attention is typically paid to the operating system layer and to privileged service frameworks that silently enable additional functionality. Unprivileged apps are constrained by Android's permission model, although some attempt to circumvent it in creative ways \cite{appDataCollection5Circumvention,appDataCollection6Circumvention}. In contrast, privileged system apps and services operate with higher access to the device and OS, which makes them harder to understand and control.
