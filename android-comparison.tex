\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comparative analysis of privacy in Android operating systems through network traffic inspection. Using a controlled man-in-the-middle setup and traffic decryption techniques, six Android distributions were evaluated: stock Google Android, GrapheneOS, iodéOS and LineageOS (stock, Gapps, microG). The study examined outbound connections, transmitted identifiers, and network traffic patterns to assess the impact of integrated Google services on user privacy. Results indicate that stock Android maintains the most communication with Google servers, transmitting identifiers and metadata even when idle. In contrast, privacy-focused systems minimize unsolicited traffic and offer stronger user control. The findings demonstrate that alternative Android distributions can substantially improve privacy without sacrificing core functionality, highlighting the potential of open-source ecosystems as viable, privacy-respecting alternatives to Google-dependent mobile environments.
